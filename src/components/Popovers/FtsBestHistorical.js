      Simple way to assess how the odds compare to a player's historical record
      at scoring the first try in a match. This is more relevant for backs and
      players who have played a larger amount of games. 100% = they are priced
      at what their career strike rate is. Yellow = 100-124%, Red = 125% and
      above.
